Abstract: Many algorithms have been proposed for the problem of time series classification. However, the influence of autocorrelation between series data is always ignored in the current methods. To deal with it, this paper presents a novel decision tree called time series decision tree (TSDT), which is based on the concept of series entropy and series pairs information gain. Moreover, we propose an Ensemble Classifier (En-TSDT) based on TSDT and Dynamic Ensemble methodology. Finally,experiments are conducted on the UCR datasets. The results shows that En-TSDT out-performs 1NN-DTW in both robustness and accuracy.
